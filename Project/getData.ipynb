       "  'full_review': 'I was extremely hyped for that movie even though I\\'m not a big fan of Fargeat\\'s debut film \"Revenge\". I liked her as a director, but not as a screenwriter. While that movie had interesting visual style, the screenplay was bad & stupid and the characters were uninteresting.However she improved a lot from her last movie. \"The Substance\" looks amazing, the shots, the score, the editing, production design and even costumes are well thought out. The screenplay is also great (she actually won an award for Best Screenplay at Cannes for \"The Substance\"), the decisions that characters are making are understandable - they are results from characters\\' determination to achieve their goals.I also loved Demi Moore\\'s perfomance (it\\'s worth mentioning that I wasn\\'t considering her good actress at all, but after watching that movie, the first thought that came to my mind was that maybe she isn\\'t a bad actress, she was just starring in bad movies), it\\'s definitely highlight of her carrer. Margaret Qualley is great as always. Even Dennis Quaid, despite little screen time, gives fun and engaging perfomance.Probably the most talked about part of that movie is gore and body horror elements. And, yeah, I must admit that this movie is pretty extreme and may be hard to watch for some viewers. Personally during those scenes I wasn\\'t feeling disgusted or smth, cause I\\'m a big fan of disturbing cinema, so I\\'m used to that stuff, but I understand that it may be a hard journey for others. That proves how great make-up artist did their job (i would be happy seeing this movie nominated for an Oscar for \"best make-up and hairstyling) and how sick and twisted Fargeat\\'s imagination is.Overall, I strongly recommend this movie. It may not be for everyone, but it\\'s worth checking out for yourself and seeing it for yourself, cause even if u don\\'t like it, u can\\'t deny is isn\\'t one of the most insane, extreme and interesting movie of this year (or even a decade).'}}"

       "   'full_review': \"The Substance: A shocking, disgusting, horrifying satirical take on celebrity culture, misogyny and the cult of youth. Elisabeth Sparkle (Demi Moore), was once a great Hollywood star but she is 50 and presents a home workout TV show, but it is a tad outdated and a horrible producer, Harvey (Dennis Quaid) decides he needs a younger star. After being involved in a car crash, Elisabeth is slipped information about a new unofficial procedure called the Substance, with which a younger self can emerges from your body in the privacy of your apartment. Now there are two but they still are one in some ways and must change places every seven days. Sue (Margaret Qualley) has natural charm and girlish beauty, she gets Elisabeth's old job in an open casting call. But she still has to absent herself from the studio every other week to let Elisabeth come back to life. Sue is now a star but there is a temptation to extend her week ... No spoilers here, more is goven away in the trailer on this very page. This breach of the Faustian pact has consequences, The suspension of disbelief regarding The Substance used and the attached processes comes easily. The film's faults (yes it has some) lie in it being maybe 10 minutes too long and the totally over the top grand guignol final sequence but even this has it's saving graces as it pays homage to many horror and science fiction films. Truly amazing make up and prostheses are put to good use, you will be convinced that Sue emerges from Elisabeth and that the other bodily changes have taken place. Awesome acting from Moore, Qualley and Quaid along with visual metaphorical references to what is taking place and close ups used to deadly effect .This isn't a film for the squeamish or faint of heart but it is a great Body Horror/Black Comedy/Satire. Co-produced, Written and Directed by Coralie Fargeat. 8/10.\",\n",

       "   'full_review': 'I have to admit, with my review of her first film (\"Revenge\"), I did Madame Fargeat an injustice because at the time I perceived it as a pseudo-feminist rape-revenge thriller with significant logic problems. But now it\\'s clear to me: the \"message\" is just the starting point - otherwise she mainly wants to have fun and bring her wonderful style to the people, which I really liked it in her first film. This time it was clear from the start: you don\\'t even need to think about suspension of disbelief: the no longer very young television celebrity Elizabeth Sparkle (Demi Moore), now lead dancer in a fitness program, is rejected by her producer (Dennis Quaid) because of her age. Then she receives the offer to create a younger version of herself (Margaret Qualley) using the substance referenced in the title. But in order to do this, rules have to be followed and this is becoming increasingly difficult, especially for the younger version - with severe consequences. And that\\'s where Fargeat comes into its own - even more so than with \"Revenge\". Body horror at its best, which almost makes Cronenberg, Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna look like beginners. Other horror films are also happily quoted (including The Shining, Carrie and Freaks) without seeming contrived or pandering. On the other hand this film is not scary in any way, even if there are effects that get quite under your skin (I\\'m just saying \"spinal cord puncture\"), instead there\\'s a lot to laugh about because of all the over-the-top action. And huge, huge respect for Demi Moore! It takes a lot of courage to expose yourself and let yourself be portrayed like that!',\n",
