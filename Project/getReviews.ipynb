       "  'Let me start out by saying: I love body horror and if you don\\'t, or if you\\'re squeamish, you might want to pass on this film. That said, I thought the balance between disturbing, impactful, intriguing, and disgusting was absolutely right on the money.In a world full where filler, botox, face lifts and implants, skin care routines, and obsession with youth are at their peak in media, THE SUBSTANCE calls into question whether the \"new, better \\'you\\'\" is really \\'you\\' - you are one, but perhaps not the same. It\\'s clever, it\\'s gross, it\\'s pointed, and it\\'s a fun watch. Moore and Qualley were an excellent duo and Quaid played a Hollywood sleezeball as believably as it could be done.'],\n",

       "  '12 minutes of standing ovation during Cannes Film Festival premiere, Demi Moore with tears in her eyes saying \\'I\\'m exhausted\\', and whispers in the festival corridors the day after - \\'This might be the Golden Palm\\'. But is it really?This film is not scary, that needs to be emphasized at the beginning. It won\\'t make your heart race, you won\\'t break out in a cold sweat, nor will you feel chills down your spine (though you might feel a slight discomfort in that part of your body).To understand what \\'The Substance\\' is about, you only need to see the first scene, or rather the first shot. It\\'s a significant beginning that sets structure for the following story.A star is being laid on the Walk of Fame in Los Angeles. Seasons pass, tourists walk by, and over the years, the first cracks appear. So, what will happen to the actual star, when she gets old? When her skin is no longer as tight as before, when the breasts are \"not in the right place\"? Our protagonist, Elizabeth Sparkle, portrayed by Demi Moore, who is presenting her film at Cannes for the first time, is about to find this out. She just turned 50 and can clearly see the end of her career approaching.But what if this fate could be changed with a mysterious substance? What if she could just not be old any more? Elizabeth Sparkle doesn\\'t need much convincing. She gets a new drug, tempted by the promise of a new life, takes the shot. And thus, \"She\" appears, a new, better, younger version.Watching \\'The Substance\\' is a cross-genre journey. We start assuming that it will be terrifying, because that\\'s what the distributor says, that it\\'s a horror, but with each passing minute, it only gets weirder and weirder.It\\'s also not entirely science fiction. The creators of the mysterious drug are not the true antagonists, we don\\'t know anything about them and we will not find out anything about them. The focus is always on Her, Elizabeth, her feelings, emotions, and needs, her fighting for herself.Demi Moore deserves great respect for this role, for incredible distance and awareness. The role, although it didn\\'t require any changes to the body mass, no heavy costumes, or learning a new language, is emotionally demanding, bold, but also reveals a lot about the actress herself (not just literally).Underneath the simple and colorful set design, among the exaggerated characters, kilograms of glitter, sensual dances, and a certain amount of nudity, we can see that this is a film about youth, beauty, the need to be noticed, but also loneliness and fear. It\\'s a bold piece of work, that certainly won\\'t appeal to everyone, but it will definitely provide everyone with an unforgettable experience.At the beginning of the film\\'s premiere screening, viewers were looking at each other. Should we laugh? Wouldn\\'t that be rude? Is this how it\\'s supposed to look? Or maybe Coralie Fargeat made a mistake, misjudged the emotional tone of the story? Well, no.Everything in this film is well thought out. From the first carefully crafted shot, through each sequence of Elizabeth taking the \\'Substance\\', to the grand finale reminiscent of Kubrick\\'s \\'The Shining\\', everything is as it should be. Waves of laughter, applause, and random screams \\'What the f is happening?!\\' are perfectly appropriate.'],\n",

The casting, atmosphere, visual and sound design, music, and, of course, the symbolism of it all.Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley couldn't have been more perfectly cast as leads. Their devotion to the process and trust in their director was clear to me. Their vulnerability pulls this off and leads to a very compelling fever dream.Everyone involved should be really proud of this film. To me, it's a future cult classic.It is body/psychological horror, so don't expect jump scares. It's deeper than that. I found myself getting lost in reflection during the film (as a 47 year old woman it really spoke to me).But it's also extremely fun to watch!Take it seriously as a true work of art, but don't at the same time, and you'll have a blast.\"],\n",

       "  \"And I've seen thousands. I estimate about 5k movies in my 39 years on this earth. I can't remember one ever hitting me this hard. I was sweating when it finished, even in a cool auditorium. Words to describe how I feel (until now, a full hour after): shocked, floored, stuck, traumatized (in a good way?). This movie affected me. It destroyed me.As soon as the credits rolled, everyone in the theater started talking to each other, saying things like wow, omg, wth, BRO, while laughing in shock. These are random people I don't know. We continued to discuss it afterwards. That's never happened to me before.Don't watch this movie if the following apply to you: You are squeamish, sensitive, or easily triggered. You don't know what body horror is. You're not familiar with dark comedies. You close your eyes at scary parts. You are looking for a date movie.If the following apply to you, go see this now, without watching a trailer or reading what it's about: You are fully desensitized. You're annoyed with all the neutered PG-13 movies. You even think modern R-rated movies are too mild and don't go all out. You feel like movies are all the same or fail to stand out.The acting is great, with Demi Moore possibly giving her best performance. All technical aspects are pristine, with the sound design/mixing standing out the most. If the director wants you to hear someone chewing obnoxiously, it will sound like the mic is in his mouth. Like the rest of the movie, everything is in your face in an intentionally off-putting way.About halfway through, I was really enjoying it, but I was worried that it would go the way of many style-over-substance movies. They rarely land for me because I need more than metaphors and deeper meanings. The Substance has those things, but still comes through with one of the most satisfying third acts I can think of.I rarely ever give 10 star ratings (excluding comedies, 13 ever). And rewatchability plays a big factor. I don't care. Even if I only watch this a couple more times, I will NEVER forget this experience, or the images that are seared into my brain forever.(2 viewings, early access screening 9/18/2024, 10/30/2024)\"],\n",

       "  'I was extremely hyped for that movie even though I\\'m not a big fan of Fargeat\\'s debut film \"Revenge\". I liked her as a director, but not as a screenwriter. While that movie had interesting visual style, the screenplay was bad & stupid and the characters were uninteresting.However she improved a lot from her last movie. \"The Substance\" looks amazing, the shots, the score, the editing, production design and even costumes are well thought out. The screenplay is also great (she actually won an award for Best Screenplay at Cannes for \"The Substance\"), the decisions that characters are making are understandable - they are results from characters\\' determination to achieve their goals.I also loved Demi Moore\\'s perfomance (it\\'s worth mentioning that I wasn\\'t considering her good actress at all, but after watching that movie, the first thought that came to my mind was that maybe she isn\\'t a bad actress, she was just starring in bad movies), it\\'s definitely highlight of her carrer. Margaret Qualley is great as always. Even Dennis Quaid, despite little screen time, gives fun and engaging perfomance.Probably the most talked about part of that movie is gore and body horror elements. And, yeah, I must admit that this movie is pretty extreme and may be hard to watch for some viewers. Personally during those scenes I wasn\\'t feeling disgusted or smth, cause I\\'m a big fan of disturbing cinema, so I\\'m used to that stuff, but I understand that it may be a hard journey for others. That proves how great make-up artist did their job (i would be happy seeing this movie nominated for an Oscar for \"best make-up and hairstyling) and how sick and twisted Fargeat\\'s imagination is.Overall, I strongly recommend this movie. It may not be for everyone, but it\\'s worth checking out for yourself and seeing it for yourself, cause even if u don\\'t like it, u can\\'t deny is isn\\'t one of the most insane, extreme and interesting movie of this year (or even a decade).'],\n",

       "  'In 2017, Coralie Fargeat\\'s directorial debut \\'Revenge\\' was released. A subversive tale of vengeance, like \\'Kill Bill\\' mixed with \\'Wolf Creek,\\' it was greeted with overwhelming praise, going on to make just under a million dollars at the box office. A strikingly shot picture overflowing with thematic weight, it showed Fargeat as a filmmaker unafraid to push boundaries and challenge conventions; a visionary with bold ideas.A notion compounded by her second feature \\'The Substance\\'. A satirical body-horror, it centres on Elisabeth Sparkle, a fading Hollywood starlet. After her 50th birthday, she is fired from her job as host of an aerobics show; her producer reasoning she is past her prime. Circumstances introduce Sparkle to a new wonder drug, creating a younger, more beautiful and perfect version of herself- if she follows the instructions, that is.\\'The Substance\\' is a wild film, most easily described as being like \\'All About Eve,\\' or \\'Sunset Boulevard,\\' if directed by David Cronenberg. It contains much thematic depth, perhaps most obviously about fame, objectification and the ridiculous beauty standards faced by females in Hollywood. Fargeat\\'s screenplay delves into the perils of a society obsessed with youth and perfection, showcasing the lengths to which individuals are willing to go to, to maintain their relevance and desirability.It is a sad truth that, traditionally, opportunities for actresses dry up after they reach a certain age. Famously, in the early 1960\\'s, Bette Davis was having such a hard time finding work that she placed an advertisement in The Hollywood Reporter, offering her services. In it, she stated that she possessed \"thirty years\\' experience as an actress in motion pictures\" and was \"mobile still and more affable than rumour would have it.\" With her narrative, Fargeat cuttingly satirises the Hollywood machine, as well as the fickleness of fame.Furthermore, as Sparkle becomes increasingly consumed by the drug and its effects, the film explores the duality of identity and the internal conflict between one\\'s true self and the facade presented to the world, echoing Oscar Wilde\\'s \\'The Picture of Dorian Gray\\' and Robert Louis Stevenson\\'s \\'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\'. Moreover, the grotesque transformations therein serve as a metaphor for the internal and external pressures faced by women in the entertainment industry. Other notions, such as addiction, control and obsession, are also examined; interwoven cleverly into the narrative and explored with tongue firmly in cheek.It is a visually arresting film, with Fargeat\\'s signature style evident in every frame. Alongside director of photography Benjamin Kracun, her use of vibrant, contrasting colours creates a surreal world for Sparkle to navigate; like some kind of 1980\\'s hellscape. Furthermore, canny homages to other filmmakers (including Roman Polanski and Stanley Kubrick) serve to heighten the sinister atmosphere of proceedings, which the use of wide-angle lenses and extreme close-ups compounds. Combined with Gladys Garot and Stanislas Reydellet\\'s meticulous production design, as well as Emmanuelle Youchnovski\\'s costumes, the visuals are unsettlingly artistic and powerful.The sound design is similarly effective at generating a sense of macabre disquiet. Much like the lush visuals, sounds are heightened to have the upmost effect. Moreover, Benjamin Stefanski\\'s score is eerie and evocative, generating much dread, while songs like Bernard Hermann\\'s \\'The Nightmare & Dawn\\' from \\'Vertigo,\\' and \\'Pump It Up\\' by Earl Gregory are used to particularly strong effect. Furthermore, it is a well-edited picture, moving at a fast pace throughout.In addition, the special effects and make-up are disgustingly breathtaking. Much like Rob Bottin\\'s incredible work for John Carpenter\\'s \\'The Thing,\\' or Chris Walas and Stephan Dupuis\\'s similarly brilliant efforts for Cronenberg\\'s \\'The Fly,\\' Pierre-Olivier Persin\\'s mostly practical effects are jaw-dropping. In the latter half in particular, they are on full display, and are never anything less than bloody amazing.Demi Moore stars as Sparkle, and is startlingly intense. She goes all out, holding nothing back- both literally and metaphorically. There are parallels between herself and the character of Sparkle, which serve only to heighten the impact of the narrative and the power of her performance. \"Fearless\" and \"brave\" are words often applied to actors, and are usually inaccurate overstatements- they\\'re only acting, after all, not firefighting. However, they are probably the best terms to describe Moore\\'s work in the film. It\\'s a gutsy performance devoid of vanity, that may be her best so far.Margaret Qualley does similarly powerful work as Sue, Sparkle\\'s alter-ego. Much like Moore, she gives everything to the role, and is equally compelling. She brings a vibrant energy and unsettling allure to proceedings, making her character sinisterly beguiling, and the film all the more gripping for it. In addition, Dennis Quaid- in a role originally meant for the late, great Ray Liotta- is magnificently manic as Sparkle\\'s producer; clearly having a ball with the material.In conclusion, \\'The Substance\\' is a thought-provoking and visually arresting film that solidifies Coralie Fargeat\\'s reputation as a bold and innovative filmmaker. By blending satirical commentary with visceral horror, Fargeat crafts a narrative that is as entertaining as it is unsettling, making the film a must-watch for fans of body horror and incisive social commentary alike. Boasting strong performances and incredible special effects, it fires on all cylinders and doesn\\'t disappoint. So, buy the ticket and take the ride, because \\'The Substance\\' is a trip worth taking.'],\n",

Until now I cannot imagine what the director and writers were thinking and what their purpose was to turn the movie this way.

They made it go about as awful as possible. But I wasn't on the edge of my seat. Instead I was just grossed out and annoyed at all of the contrivances which allowed for such a tragic concluding spectacle.The film's visuals were pretty good if not a bit heavy handed. The sound design and score were pretty effective. The premise of the story was good. The actors did a fine job. And all of that made the end of the story that much more disappointing, given the potential. I suspect the positives are why the movie had gotten so much positive hype.

       "   'full_review': \"The Substance: A shocking, disgusting, horrifying satirical take on celebrity culture, misogyny and the cult of youth. Elisabeth Sparkle (Demi Moore), was once a great Hollywood star but she is 50 and presents a home workout TV show, but it is a tad outdated and a horrible producer, Harvey (Dennis Quaid) decides he needs a younger star. After being involved in a car crash, Elisabeth is slipped information about a new unofficial procedure called the Substance, with which a younger self can emerges from your body in the privacy of your apartment. Now there are two but they still are one in some ways and must change places every seven days. Sue (Margaret Qualley) has natural charm and girlish beauty, she gets Elisabeth's old job in an open casting call. But she still has to absent herself from the studio every other week to let Elisabeth come back to life. Sue is now a star but there is a temptation to extend her week ... No spoilers here, more is goven away in the trailer on this very page. This breach of the Faustian pact has consequences, The suspension of disbelief regarding The Substance used and the attached processes comes easily. The film's faults (yes it has some) lie in it being maybe 10 minutes too long and the totally over the top grand guignol final sequence but even this has it's saving graces as it pays homage to many horror and science fiction films. Truly amazing make up and prostheses are put to good use, you will be convinced that Sue emerges from Elisabeth and that the other bodily changes have taken place. Awesome acting from Moore, Qualley and Quaid along with visual metaphorical references to what is taking place and close ups used to deadly effect .This isn't a film for the squeamish or faint of heart but it is a great Body Horror/Black Comedy/Satire. Co-produced, Written and Directed by Coralie Fargeat. 8/10.\",\n",

       "   'full_review': 'I have to admit, with my review of her first film (\"Revenge\"), I did Madame Fargeat an injustice because at the time I perceived it as a pseudo-feminist rape-revenge thriller with significant logic problems. But now it\\'s clear to me: the \"message\" is just the starting point - otherwise she mainly wants to have fun and bring her wonderful style to the people, which I really liked it in her first film. This time it was clear from the start: you don\\'t even need to think about suspension of disbelief: the no longer very young television celebrity Elizabeth Sparkle (Demi Moore), now lead dancer in a fitness program, is rejected by her producer (Dennis Quaid) because of her age. Then she receives the offer to create a younger version of herself (Margaret Qualley) using the substance referenced in the title. But in order to do this, rules have to be followed and this is becoming increasingly difficult, especially for the younger version - with severe consequences. And that\\'s where Fargeat comes into its own - even more so than with \"Revenge\". Body horror at its best, which almost makes Cronenberg, Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna look like beginners. Other horror films are also happily quoted (including The Shining, Carrie and Freaks) without seeming contrived or pandering. On the other hand this film is not scary in any way, even if there are effects that get quite under your skin (I\\'m just saying \"spinal cord puncture\"), instead there\\'s a lot to laugh about because of all the over-the-top action. And huge, huge respect for Demi Moore! It takes a lot of courage to expose yourself and let yourself be portrayed like that!',\n",

      "       In 2017, Coralie Fargeat's directorial debut 'Revenge' was released. A subversive tale of vengeance, like 'Kill Bill' mixed with 'Wolf Creek,' it was greeted with overwhelming praise, going on to make just under a million dollars at the box office. A strikingly shot picture overflowing with thematic weight, it showed Fargeat as a filmmaker unafraid to push boundaries and challenge conventions; a visionary with bold ideas.\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       A notion compounded by her second feature 'The Substance'. A satirical body-horror, it centres on Elisabeth Sparkle, a fading Hollywood starlet. After her 50th birthday, she is fired from her job as host of an aerobics show; her producer reasoning she is past her prime. Circumstances introduce Sparkle to a new wonder drug, creating a younger, more beautiful and perfect version of herself- if she follows the instructions, that is.\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       'The Substance' is a wild film, most easily described as being like 'All About Eve,' or 'Sunset Boulevard,' if directed by David Cronenberg. It contains much thematic depth, perhaps most obviously about fame, objectification and the ridiculous beauty standards faced by females in Hollywood. Fargeat's screenplay delves into the perils of a society obsessed with youth and perfection, showcasing the lengths to which individuals are willing to go to, to maintain their relevance and desirability.\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       It is a sad truth that, traditionally, opportunities for actresses dry up after they reach a certain age. Famously, in the early 1960's, Bette Davis was having such a hard time finding work that she placed an advertisement in The Hollywood Reporter, offering her services. In it, she stated that she possessed \"thirty years' experience as an actress in motion pictures\" and was \"mobile still and more affable than rumour would have it.\" With her narrative, Fargeat cuttingly satirises the Hollywood machine, as well as the fickleness of fame.\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       Furthermore, as Sparkle becomes increasingly consumed by the drug and its effects, the film explores the duality of identity and the internal conflict between one's true self and the facade presented to the world, echoing Oscar Wilde's 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' and Robert Louis Stevenson's 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'. Moreover, the grotesque transformations therein serve as a metaphor for the internal and external pressures faced by women in the entertainment industry. Other notions, such as addiction, control and obsession, are also examined; interwoven cleverly into the narrative and explored with tongue firmly in cheek.\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       It is a visually arresting film, with Fargeat's signature style evident in every frame. Alongside director of photography Benjamin Kracun, her use of vibrant, contrasting colours creates a surreal world for Sparkle to navigate; like some kind of 1980's hellscape. Furthermore, canny homages to other filmmakers (including Roman Polanski and Stanley Kubrick) serve to heighten the sinister atmosphere of proceedings, which the use of wide-angle lenses and extreme close-ups compounds. Combined with Gladys Garot and Stanislas Reydellet's meticulous production design, as well as Emmanuelle Youchnovski's costumes, the visuals are unsettlingly artistic and powerful.\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       The sound design is similarly effective at generating a sense of macabre disquiet. Much like the lush visuals, sounds are heightened to have the upmost effect. Moreover, Benjamin Stefanski's score is eerie and evocative, generating much dread, while songs like Bernard Hermann's 'The Nightmare &amp; Dawn' from 'Vertigo,' and 'Pump It Up' by Earl Gregory are used to particularly strong effect. Furthermore, it is a well-edited picture, moving at a fast pace throughout.\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       In addition, the special effects and make-up are disgustingly breathtaking. Much like Rob Bottin's incredible work for John Carpenter's 'The Thing,' or Chris Walas and Stephan Dupuis's similarly brilliant efforts for Cronenberg's 'The Fly,' Pierre-Olivier Persin's mostly practical effects are jaw-dropping. In the latter half in particular, they are on full display, and are never anything less than bloody amazing.\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       Demi Moore stars as Sparkle, and is startlingly intense. She goes all out, holding nothing back- both literally and metaphorically. There are parallels between herself and the character of Sparkle, which serve only to heighten the impact of the narrative and the power of her performance. \"Fearless\" and \"brave\" are words often applied to actors, and are usually inaccurate overstatements- they're only acting, after all, not firefighting. However, they are probably the best terms to describe Moore's work in the film. It's a gutsy performance devoid of vanity, that may be her best so far.\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       Margaret Qualley does similarly powerful work as Sue, Sparkle's alter-ego. Much like Moore, she gives everything to the role, and is equally compelling. She brings a vibrant energy and unsettling allure to proceedings, making her character sinisterly beguiling, and the film all the more gripping for it. In addition, Dennis Quaid- in a role originally meant for the late, great Ray Liotta- is magnificently manic as Sparkle's producer; clearly having a ball with the material.\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       In conclusion, 'The Substance' is a thought-provoking and visually arresting film that solidifies Coralie Fargeat's reputation as a bold and innovative filmmaker. By blending satirical commentary with visceral horror, Fargeat crafts a narrative that is as entertaining as it is unsettling, making the film a must-watch for fans of body horror and incisive social commentary alike. Boasting strong performances and incredible special effects, it fires on all cylinders and doesn't disappoint. So, buy the ticket and take the ride, because 'The Substance' is a trip worth taking.\n",

It's is an experience to say the least. You will laugh, you will look away, your jaw will drop, you will feel uncomfortable. But it's all worth it. It's incredible filmmaking, award winning acting and a smashing soundtrack all in one. Huge applause to Demi for taking on such a vulnerable role covering a subject that is rarely discussed.

From the opening scene, this film grabs you with its stunning cinematography and powerhouse performances by Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley. The 2.5-hour runtime flies by, leaving you wishing it would never end. This movie is an instant cult classic, blending a fantastic score with razor-sharp social satire that feels both timely and timeless.\n",

      "       This is a desperately overrated film. It's an interesting watch, for sure, but as a whole it falls flat. While the director utilizes artistry for the story, ultimately the plot holes are undeniable, and worst of all, the ending is just ridiculous to the point where everything good that they were selling for the first hour about it devolves into a mess of a movie.\n",

Instead, it just devolves into a vapid gore fest in the third act that is just meant to stir up publicity and cause shock.\n",

It has those very few elements at times of a masterpiece like many movies that try to push boundaries do, but ultimately it's a bad movie that doesn't even come close to a Wes Craven Scream film, and those aren't even masterpieces.\n",

      "       The Substance: A shocking, disgusting, horrifying satirical take on celebrity culture, misogyny and the cult of youth. Elisabeth Sparkle (Demi Moore), was once a great Hollywood star but she is 50 and presents a home workout TV show, but it is a tad outdated and a horrible producer, Harvey (Dennis Quaid) decides he needs a younger star. After being involved in a car crash, Elisabeth is slipped information about a new unofficial procedure called the Substance, with which a younger self can emerges from your body in the privacy of your apartment. Now there are two but they still are one in some ways and must change places every seven days. Sue (Margaret Qualley) has natural charm and girlish beauty, she gets Elisabeth's old job in an open casting call. But she still has to absent herself from the studio every other week to let Elisabeth come back to life. Sue is now a star but there is a temptation to extend her week ... No spoilers here, more is goven away in the trailer on this very page. This breach of the Faustian pact has consequences, The suspension of disbelief regarding The Substance used and the attached processes comes easily. The film's faults (yes it has some) lie in it being maybe 10 minutes too long and the totally over the top grand guignol final sequence but even this has it's saving graces as it pays homage to many horror and science fiction films. Truly amazing make up and prostheses are put to good use, you will be convinced that Sue emerges from Elisabeth and that the other bodily changes have taken place. Awesome acting from Moore, Qualley and Quaid along with visual metaphorical references to what is taking place and close ups used to deadly effect .This isn't a film for the squeamish or faint of heart but it is a great Body Horror/Black Comedy/Satire. Co-produced, Written and Directed by Coralie Fargeat. 8/10.\n",

      "       I have to admit, with my review of her first film (\"Revenge\"), I did Madame Fargeat an injustice because at the time I perceived it as a pseudo-feminist rape-revenge thriller with significant logic problems. But now it's clear to me: the \"message\" is just the starting point - otherwise she mainly wants to have fun and bring her wonderful style to the people, which I really liked it in her first film. This time it was clear from the start: you don't even need to think about suspension of disbelief: the no longer very young television celebrity Elizabeth Sparkle (Demi Moore), now lead dancer in a fitness program, is rejected by her producer (Dennis Quaid) because of her age. Then she receives the offer to create a younger version of herself (Margaret Qualley) using the substance referenced in the title. But in order to do this, rules have to be followed and this is becoming increasingly difficult, especially for the younger version - with severe consequences. And that's where Fargeat comes into its own - even more so than with \"Revenge\". Body horror at its best, which almost makes Cronenberg, Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna look like beginners. Other horror films are also happily quoted (including The Shining, Carrie and Freaks) without seeming contrived or pandering. On the other hand this film is not scary in any way, even if there are effects that get quite under your skin (I'm just saying \"spinal cord puncture\"), instead there's a lot to laugh about because of all the over-the-top action. And huge, huge respect for Demi Moore! It takes a lot of courage to expose yourself and let yourself be portrayed like that!\n",

      "       I saw this movie yesterday, but I had to sleep and cool down before commenting. This is the type of screening where, after the movie, when you go downstairs in screening room, your legs hurt and your body still feels the experience. The most disgusting and the most sexy movie I have ever seen AT THE SAME TIME, what a crazy combination. Guadanino's Challengers meets Cronenberg's Fly. Perfect casting in every role. A wonderful scene when the main character fights with herself while getting ready for a date. Depiction of TV sexualization, but also hypocrisy of its stars and the way they're addicted to this system, they need it for their self-esteem.\n",

      "1. There are literally only 6 films that received the maximum rating from me and to be included in that group, there must be absolutely nothing that bothers me about the film. Even though I can aware of some elements that are not perfect and that many people have problems with, I do not have this problem.\n",

      "       <br/>\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       3. Simple metaphors, which I generally have no problem with and it works very well here, but such simplicity has its limitations and you can't achieve perfection this way in my opinion.\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       4. The plot is very simple and predictable. It works through great story telling, but well, here we come back to the limitations of simplicity. These limitations could only be overcome if the movie had great personal meaning for me and I don't feel it here. The surprises in this film were only in form, never in content.\n",
      "       <br/>\n",

      "       Just like the aberrant cellular activity triggered from misusing its titular substance, Coralie Fargeat's film snaps radioactively into many layers of reference, and does so without breaking a sweat. Beyond the obvious Cronenberg or Kubrick, there's a fair bit of Frankenheimeran bad vibes (up to the fish eye lenses and general feel of disorientation), Verhoeven and De Palma's garishness (both from their vintage and newer films), even some of Robert Zemeckis' sparkly 80s and 90s blockbusters (complete with twinkling sounds in the score). The Cinema du Look and Gaspar Noe, both from Fargeat's native France, are other entry points, though far from the only ones.\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       But The Substance is much more than just catnip for cinephiles. Fargeat's greatest feat is that her film can never be pinned down and that it knows exactly when to entertain, when to shock and when to be absolutely ridiculous. In fact, it frequently manages to do the three in one sitting! It's rare to see a film be so bold about its silliness without lowering it to self-conscious irony. This is mainly possible to the writing, which rarely sits in one place and leaves no direction untouched. Whether it goes for despairing tragicomedy, scientifically minded body horror or All About Eve-style bitchiness, nothing tumbles under its own padding. Fargeat knows exactly what she wants to do and how to get there. Best screenplay at Cannes? I think so!\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       Our liberal societies love to pay lip service to the dignity of calloused hands, while at the same time, in a strange act of hypocrisy, applaud the young hot girl as the ultimate measure of freedom and authenticity. In that sense, Margaret Qualley is brilliant. There's something Megan Fox-y about her casting as she perfectly tunes into Sue's quest for instant gratification. The fact that both Sue and Elizabeth are aspects of the same fractured psyche further prove how when botomless, vanity can be a monster of its own undoing, no matter the age. Elizabeth cannot stand not being young and hip anymore, Sue is terrified of losing what she has if the biological distress her own body was born out of ever takes over.\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       Benjamin Kracun's cinematography aids the film in making both old and young look grotesque, playing with our own distorted views of the hag but also letting hot youth luxuriate to a point where it turns nauseating. His insert shots turn the bottom of an ashtray to lipstick being applied to a pair of blood sausages into pieces of graphic art. Carpeted hallways, a posh bathroom turned hub for injectables, the gritty streets of an LA slum... It's a world that is beautifully shot but that you'd be hardly pressed to call beautiful in itself.\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       Much has also been made about how extreme The Substance is in its gore and body horror. I think that depends on one's level of resistance and even love for the thing but for me at least, it was far from being as extreme as publicized. Right until the end when it erupts into pure B-movie splatter, more than the gore itself, what left me breathless was how it all added up like in an avalanche, along with so much flashiness and beauty.\n",

      "       <br/>\n",
      "       So let's dive in.\n",

      "       <br/>\n",
      "       Firstly, there was absolutely no character development, from beginning to end. The only thing we know about Elisabeth Sparkle, played by Demi Moore, is that she is obsessed with keeping her youth. We don't even know why. Is it the accolades? Is it because she loves her work? Is it simply the attention?\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       Beyond that, she is completely devoid of anything resembling a personality. There's no humour. No specific mannerisms. Nothing whatsoever that gives her a glimmer of memorability.\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       Then comes her younger self, Sue (played by Margaret Qualley), who is equally lacking in personality, beyond an endless self satisfaction at her youthful appearance.\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       Every character in this film felt like a narrative device rather than an individual acting rationally within the world the film makers created.\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       Second was the plot holes, of which there were many. Some were more unforgivable than others, but compiled together, they made for an incredibly frustrating watch:\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       1. The most advanced medical solution for anti-aging ever formulated, available only to the absurdly wealthy, is distributed - seemingly for free - from a dinghy back alley in a rough neighborhood (somewhat forgivable).\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       2. The main premise is that Moore's character has split into two bodies, but she is still of one mind. This is the sole reason she has for sacrificing the health of her old body, so that she can experience life again as an attractive young woman.\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       But as the story goes in, it is made apparent that they aren't actually experiencing each others' lives. Which means Moore's older self gets absolutely zero gain from using the substance, neither in social status or personal experience. But still she clings to it, presumably to drive the story in the direction the writer wanted it to go. (Betraying the main premise on which your film is based for narrative convenience is, to me, unforgivable).\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       3. Young Sue, who is shown barely being able to swing a sledgehammer or use a drill, is able to construct a secret doorway in her bathroom to hide the body of her older self, that perfectly blends in, re-tiled and grouted to perfection. A feat any experienced contractor would be proud of.\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       4. The old version of Sparkle becomes progressively more decrepit, old and, as a result, immobile. In her near final form, she is almost unable to walk and has to crawl laboriously from place to place. Then, when the two selves come face to face (again, belying the premise), the hideous version of Sparkle is suddenly embued with superhuman speed and strength as the two selves try to kill eachother.\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       The scene of this hideously deformed creature doing a 100 meter dash down a hallway, followed by a full on fight scene with her younger self, was one of the most unintentionally funny things I've ever witnessed in a movie.\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       5. In the last moments of the film, once Sparkle has taken her final, most hideous form, she somehow manages to end up on stage for a performance in front of her boss and adoring fans. Of course, no one notices this massively deformed creature as it wonders past security. And when the crowd sees it on stage, everyone assumes (god knows why - narrative convenience?) that the beast is the young and attractive Sue, despite it bearing no resemblance to her whatsoever.\n",

      "       <br/>\n",
      "       Next we have \"The Message\". Adding yet another layer of absurdity to The Substance was the attempt at injecting some kind of broad message around female beauty standards into a movie that didn't even have a clear vision of itself yet alone society at large. The result being that The Message was pushed in a simultaneously hamfisted yet utterly incoherent manner.\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       <br/>\n",

      "       <br/>\n",
      "       2. The insane beauty standards placed on women are 100% the fault of said greedy, pathetic men.\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       It's not that women go to greater and greater lengths to compete with each other, thus creating an arms race of make-up, Botox and butt surgery. Or that the reason a greedy capitalist might want a younger female dancer is because his entirely female audience demands it. No, it's simply because rich old men love to ogle at hot young women.\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       Juxtaposed with this attempt to \"smash beauty norms\" were some of the most gratuitously, unnecessarily close-up shots of young women's asses and semi-naked bodies I've ever seen in a film. Even as a heterosexual man I was getting tired of the overly long, borderline pornographic scenes of scantily clad dancers.\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       Meanwhile, the portrayal of aging was one of becoming progressively more grotesque and hideous. With each misuse of the Substance, a part of Moore's character rapidly ages in the most hideous way imaginable, which results in disgust from herself and from us, the audience.\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       And so the movie becomes exactly the thing it set out to challenge. It puts youth and sex appeal on a pedestal. The movie (and its, funnily enough, male cinematographer) ogles and drools over attractive young women while it shows revulsion at the aging of Sparkle.\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       The good - I can't really praise Moore's performance since her character had none, but accepting the role in the first place deserves some kudos.\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       <br/>\n",
      "       The movie also achieved its latter half goal of being utterly disgusting. Well done to the animatronics team. And if the intention was to make the final few scenes unpleasant in every way imaginable, then well done to the audio department. They certainly achieved that goal.\n",
